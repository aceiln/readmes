# ReadMe Generator
## Description
The motivation of this project was supported by the determination to further my understanding and confidence within the certain points of node. I want to familiarize myself with the features of this system and understand different ways I can learn about programming. The problem that it solves is to assist in making an automatically generated and formatted readme file, which will be a lot easier to do if its an automatic input and creation file. I was able to learn how to work with node, and the different issues that might come up while trying to boot it.

## Installation
in order for this to run, you have to open the bash terminal and engage within the code using 'node index.js' within the directory.
## Usage
The instructions are relatively simple, answer the questions, and drag-and-drop the new readme file (which is located under the output folder) out to be displayed as necessary.
